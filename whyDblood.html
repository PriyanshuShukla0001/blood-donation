    </p>


    <h1>Benefits for the donor</h1>
    <p class="wd2">Each person who donate blood complete a simple physical examination and blood test before giving
        blood.</p>
    <p class="wd2">These are not in-depth tests, but they may helps identify unknown concerns, such as
        <strong>anemia</strong> or high or low <strong>blood pressure</strong></p>
    <p>The test will check the person's</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="wd4">blood pressure</li>
        <li class="wd4">body temperature</li>
        <li class="wd4">heart rate</li>
        <li class="wd4">hemoglobin, or iron levels</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="wd2">If the test reveals a problem, the person will not be able to donate blood. However, the results
        could be a first step
        toward seeking treatment.</p>
    <h2>Weight management</h2>
    <p class="wd2">There are claims ,Trusted Source that giving blood burns 650 calories. However, there does not appear
        to be any scientific
        evidence to prove this. Any benefits of this calorie loss will be short-term and will not help a person lose
        weight.</p>
    <p class="wd2">However, a study of 2012, A trusted Source suggests that because blood donation centers need to weigh
        people before they give blood, this could help identify people with obesity and offer them help to manage their
        weight and any related health problems.</p>
    <p class="wd2">It can also identify people with a low weight, who may also benefit from counseling and advice.</p>
    <h2>LOWER IRON LEVELS</h2>
    <P class="wd2"> Studies suggest that many of us consume more iron that we need to maintain good health. Lower the
        iron levels have on your body every time gove you, ehich can help to reduce the risk of heart disease.</P>
    <p class="wd2">High blood iron levels have the potential to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease because iron
        accelerate the process of cholestrol in the body, which damegea arteries. Iron stimulates cells to churn out
        free redicals, molecules that may contribute to cancer and other diseas of aging. Studies show that high iron
        levels in your body are also associated with premature agimg.</p>
    <p class="wd2">Women tend to outlive men and are generally better at postponing the onset of age-releted disease,
        and one theory involves iron loss due to menstruation</p>
    <h3>Do you have high iron levels ?</h3>
    <p class="wd2">Get your levels checked to find out. Ferritin measures iron stores in the blood. Levels between 50
        and 500ng/ml are ideal. Levels below this 50ng/ml can cause problem, such as anxiety , fatigue, restless legs,
        and ADHD(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). High levels, over 250ng/ml are associated with iron overload
        and increase the risk inflammation, heart disease and neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's and
        Alzheimer's disease </p>
    <h3>REDUCE HEART ATTACK RISK</h3>
    <p class="wd2">High levels of iron in the blood have brrn sited as a risk factor for heart attack. Regular blood
        donor cal mitigate that risk .Research show that men who Donate regularly over many years have an 88% lower risk
        of the heart attack and a 33% lower risk of any severe cardiovascular event, such as a stroke. </p>
    <h3>REDUCE CANCER RISK</h3>
    <p class="wd2">High iron levels can also contribute to te development and growth o tumors. A 2014 study in Cancer
        research found that high iron levels in the blood were associated with a 25% increased risk of all cancers and a
        39% increase in the risk of dying from cancer. And consuming large amount of dietary iron is linked with
        increased risk of colestrol cancer</p>
    <p class="wd2">Consistent blood donation id associated eith lowered risk for cancers, includung lungs, lung, colon,
        stomuch, and throat cancer .Risk levels Dropped in correlation eiht how often participants donated blood .<i>As
