        <h1>&nbsp&nbspWho Can Give Blood</h1>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMost people can give blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.  Below are some basic &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspeligibility guidelines:</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAge</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are aged between 18 and 65.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.</li>
            <li>In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries are 60.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWeight</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou weigh at least 50 kg.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHealth</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou must be in good health at the time you donate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a registered &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphealth professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood after 12 hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A test will be administered at the donation site. In many countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTravel</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTravel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMany countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspareas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBehaviours</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou must not give blood:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months</li>
            <li>Individuals with behaviours below will be deferred permanently:</li>
            <li>Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)</li>
            <li>Have ever injected recreational drugs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the national blood donor selection guidelines, there are more behavior eligibility criteria. Criteria could be different in different countries.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPregnancy and breastfeeding</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFollowing pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbaby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).</p>
